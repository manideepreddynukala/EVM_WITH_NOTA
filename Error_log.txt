1)'cout' does not name a type
The problem is that the code you have that does the printing is outside of any function. Statements in C++ need to be inside a function.

2)cout was not declared in this scope
using namespace std;

3)in C++98 's' must be initialized by constructor, not by '{...}'
Initialization used by you is called initializer list and it is supported c++11 onwards.
To ensure code is compiled, use C++11 or later -std option. Or in general, don't use C++98.
If you are using g++, please read: Compiling C++11 with g++
Go to Toolbar -> Settings -> Compiler
In the "Selected compiler" drop-down menu, make sure "GNU GCC Compiler" is selected
Below that, select the "compiler settings" tab and then the "compiler flags" tab underneath
In the list below, make sure the box for "Have g++ follow the C++11 ISO C++ language standard [-std=c++11]" is checked
